I added part of the code . So how it works it compares combo box with a range from spread sheet and if value matches it copies entire row and paste in textbox within the user forum. The only issue is there is no concatenation or border line to make the date readable. Can someone help me with that 
````
       For i = 2 To last_row
            lookupVal = Cells(i, office_str)
            ' Compare ComboBox with the range from the spreadsheet
            If lookupVal = Office_Code Then
                ' Copy and paste the entire row if the value matches in the TextBox-UserForum
                Cells(i, office_str).EntireRow.Copy
                Client_Finder.result.Paste
            End If
        Next i

```````
Current outcome : 
```
cat   83734-232-       dog
342     423
````
Desired outcome:

```
cat   83734-232  dog  342     423

```
Thank you.
